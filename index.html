        I normally make my body work out on those three sections through the week, yes seven days. If that helps, I combine it like this;<br>
        Monday Tuesday and Wednesday – Gym exercises<br>
        Thursday, Friday and Saturday – Swimming<br>
        Sundays – Yoga<br>
        *This combination helps your body not be bored with gym exercises only* <br>

      <p> But not only do gym into my routine, but I do also do some reading. I like fiction books the most, make your brain imagine the world while you’re reading it feels good, hopes no one steals our imagination is the best we have made our minds blow, now the “metaverse” is coming to get me worried as people could possibly not be interested in reading anymore and not use their own imagination. Even though I love technology and how makes your life easier in all ways I encourage people to keep reading.
